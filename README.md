Ripple is a small convenience to create ripples in your app. With just a line of code, you can do beautiful things.

## Code

There are two types of ripples, the one times ones, or the repeated ones:

#### Droplets

By just setting the center and the view the droplet should be added to, you are going to have a droplet effect.

```swift
droplet(center: CGPoint, view: UIView)
```

#### Ripples

There are many ways to customize the ripple effect, the simplest one of all is just calling the following lines, which will repeat infinite times.

```swift
ripple(center: CGPoint, view: UIView)
```

There is, in both cases some configuration you can find, read the documentation for more information. :) Here's the gif of the demo for you to have an idea of what Ripple is:
